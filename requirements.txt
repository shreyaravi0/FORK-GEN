Notes:
DeepFace may require additional backend dependencies (e.g., tensorflow, torch, or keras), depending on your configuration.
Whisper relies on PyTorch; ensure compatibility with your hardware.
Rembg may also require ONNX Runtime or additional image libraries. If needed, add:
plaintext
Copy code
onnxruntime==1.13.1
Post-Installation Setup
NLTK: Run the following in a Python shell after installing nltk to download necessary data:
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
Environment Variables: Place your API keys in a .env file for secure handling with python-dotenv.
This setup should cover the main dependencies required to run your project. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything specific to add or adjust!
